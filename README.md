# Quasar App (agile-challenge)

A Quasar Framework app

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).

### What I had do 

the api Key was not working, I had to work with my personal backend, and add their the endpoints that I needed.
